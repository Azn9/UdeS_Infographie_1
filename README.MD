This project is a custom game engine made in C++ during the autumn session of the Master of Sciences, specialization in video game programming, at the University of Sherbrooke, Canada.



## How to build?
~~Run the "rebuild.bat" file. You will need cmake for it to work.
This will create a "build" folder. The project sln file is inside.~~

Due to GitHub LFS limitations, all the data (textures, models etc.) are not archived here.
